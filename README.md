### Running in Android Studio Emulator

* Clone this Project Directory **OR** Download Project .zip [here](https://github.com/AlexDuthie/xylophone-app/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
* Open Cloned Project in Android Studio
* Run [lib/main.dart](lib/main.dart) in a specified emulator

> Flutter is quite a reactive framework so most of the changes you make will be 'painted' onto the emulator screen simultaneously, this is called 'Hot Reload'.
